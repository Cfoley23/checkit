# checkit

This is a portfolio project for NuCamp Coding BootCamp inspired by project manager tools available today.
Users will be able to create an account and save lists of tasks to be completed.
You will also be able to share those lists with other users and be able to collaborate with one another.

Features will be announced here as they are added.
